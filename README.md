# Arduino-Uno-Blinking-Light-Project
This is a simple beginner project for arduino programming using the arduino uno board.

## Required Hardware
.Arduino Board
.LED
.220 Ohm Resister
This LED is connected to the digital pin and its number may vary from board type to board type.
To make your life earsier, there is a constant that is described in evry descriptor files.
This constant is <code> LED_BUILTIN <code> which allows you to control the BUILTIN LED easily.
## HOW TO BUILT THE CIRCUIT
~
- Connect one end of the resistor(220ohms) to the LED_BUILTIN constant.
- Connect the long leg of the LED(positive leg, called the anode) to the other end of the resistor.
- Connect the short leg of the LED(negative leg, called cathode) to the GND.
